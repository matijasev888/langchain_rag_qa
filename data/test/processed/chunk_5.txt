This set-up is well-balanced for all players.
Before your first game, you must remove the die-cut 
components from the cardboard holders. Carefully punch  out and separate the pieces. When punching tiles out of the die-cut sheets, always push the tiles through from the front, “cut” side (pushing from the back may cause the tiles to rip).
Lay out the map as specified in Illustration A (or on the 
back of this booklet).
First, assemble the frame as shown. Second, create Catan 
by placing the 19 terrain hexes on the table—again as shown. Third, place the circular number tokens on top of  the designated terrain hexes. Finally, place your settlements and roads.
