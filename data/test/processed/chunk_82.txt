1616The island of Catan lies before you. The isle consists of  
19 terrain tiles surrounded by ocean. Your goal is to settle on 
Catan, and expand your territory until it becomes the largest and most glorious in Catan.
There are five productive terrain types and one desert on Catan. Each terrain type produces a different type of resource (The 
desert produces nothing). Each resource you receive is represented by a card. Here’s what each terrain produces:You only collect resources if you own a settlement or city bordering these terrain hexes. In the illustration, the red 
settlement [A] borders the “10” mountains and orange settlement [B] borders the “10” hills. If a “10” is rolled, the red player receives 1 ore card and the orange player receives 1 brick card.
