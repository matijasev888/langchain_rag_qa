resour Ce produ Ction
On your turn, you must roll the dice for the turn’s resource 
production. The number rolled determines which hexes produce resources. Each number appears twice—except for “2” and “12,” which only appear once.
All players who have settlements Y  or cities Y  on the hexes 
indicated by the roll receive the yields (resource cards) of those hexes. Each settlement produces 1 resource card and each city produces 2 resource cards.
