3. Build Y
Now you can build. Through building, you can increase your 
victory points Y , expand your road network, improve your 
resource production, and/or buy useful development cards. To build, you must pay specific combinations of resource cards (see the Building Costs Card Y ). Take the appropriate number 
of roads, settlements, and/or cities from your supply and place them on the game board. Keep development cards hidden in your hand.
You cannot build more pieces than what is available in your 
pool—a maximum of 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads.
