pool—a maximum of 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads.
a) Road Y  Requires: Brick & Lumber
A new road must always connect to 1 of your existing roads, 
settlements, or cities. Only 1 road can be 
built on any given path Y .
The first player to build a continuous 
road (not counting forks) of at least 5 road segments receives the special card “Longest Road Y .” If another player 
succeeds in building a longer road than the one created by the current owner of the “Longest Road” card, they immediately take the special card (and its 2 victory points). Tip: This creates a 4 victory point swing!
