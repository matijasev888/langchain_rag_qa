You have arrived on the island of Catan. Its uninhabited lands lie before you, 
stretching for miles in all directions. It offers the promise of bountiful harvests  
and plentiful resources. As you make plans to build a new life here, you discover 
that you are not alone. Several other newly-arrived leaders are planning their 
futures here as well. The race to build a bright and prosperous new community has 
begun!
The CATAN® – 5-6 Player Extension™ (aka CATAN 5-6) allows you to add one to two 
players to your CATAN games. The island is larger, the demand for resources is fiercer, and 
the thrills are even greater!
NOTE: This 2022 revision has new “paired player” rules that replace the special building phase
