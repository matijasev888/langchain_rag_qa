You then steal 1 resource card from a player who has a 
settlement or a city adjacent to the robber. If there are 2 or more such players, you may choose your victim.
The player you elect to rob keeps their cards face down while 
you take 1 of their cards at random. If that player has no cards, you get nothing! (However, you can always ask players about the number of cards they hold. They must answer truthfully.)
If you are the first player to have 3 knight cards face up in 
front of you, you take the “Largest Army” Y  special card. This 
special card is worth 2 victory points.
If another player has more face-up knight cards than you, 
they take the special card and the 2 victory points that go with it.
