For 5-6 experienced players: Once you are comfortable with the 5-6 player rules, add 
the terrain hexes to the frame as follows:
1.   Shuffle all 30 terrain hexes face down and place them face down inside the frame.
2.  Turn the hexes face up, without changing their location.
3.  Take the number tokens from CATAN 5-6 (brown letters on back).  
Place the number token labeled “A” on any one of the six corner hexes (we chose the 
upper right in our example on page 5). Continue placing the tokens in alphabetical 
order along a spiral, starting on the outside hexes and proceeding counter-clockwise
