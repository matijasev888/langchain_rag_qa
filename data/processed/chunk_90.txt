22Note: When you want to play with 3-4 players again, we have made it easy to separate the 
cardboard CATAN 5-6 components from the CATAN components. 
•  Look at the front of the terrain hexes. The CATAN 5-6 hexes all have a 
watermark icon (depicted here) printed in the lower left corner.  
CATAN terrain hexes have no watermarks.
•  Look at the back of the number tokens. The letters on the back of the 
CATAN 5-6 tokens are dark brown. The letters on the standard CATAN 
number tokens are black.Game Components
