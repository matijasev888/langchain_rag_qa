If you are the first player to build a 
continuous road of at least 5 individual 
road pieces, you take this special card and place it face up in front of you. This card is worth 2 victory points.
Note: If your road network branches, you may only count the single longest branch for purposes of the longest road.
If you hold the “Longest Road” card and another player 
builds a longer road, they immediately take your “Longest Road” card. They also acquire the 2 bonus victory points. (Since you also lose the 2 victory points, it is a 4 point swing!)
Example: See Illustration I. Emily, the red player, builds a continuous road with 7 wooden pieces (A–B). The branch roads (marked with arrows) are not counted. Emily snags the “Longest Road” special card.
