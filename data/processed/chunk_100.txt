Paired Player Rules
The phases used in CATAN remain generally the same. Player 1 rolls the dice for the 
turn. However, during the trade/build phase, both player 1 and player 2 can take actions. 
Player 1 must always complete their portion of the paired turn before player 2 can begin 
their portion.
