the paired turn.
Player 2 may do the following in any order:
• Trade cards ONLY with the supply.
• Build anything shown on your “Building Costs” card and play 1 development card  
as usual (even VP cards to win the game).
After player 2 completes their part of the turn, the paired players each pass their 
respective markers to the player on their left. Player 1 also passes the dice. The new 
player 1 starts a new turn.
Ending the Game Clarifications
You win the game if you are the first player to reach 10 or more victory points on your 
turn (as in CATAN). However, if there is ever an instance when both player 1 and  
player 2 reach 10 points during the same turn, player 1 wins the game before player 2  
can take their part of the paired turn.
