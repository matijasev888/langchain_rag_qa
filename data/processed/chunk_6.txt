Starting Set-up for Experienced Players
It is more fun to play with a variable game board—with the 
game board laid out randomly. The board changes each game. 
If you would like to use the variable set-up, you can find the guidelines in the Almanac under Set-up, Variable Y . Also look 
for useful tips under Set-up Phase Y  and Tactics Y .

Select a color and take your 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 
15 roads (no more and no less!). Place your 2 roads and your 2 settlements on the game board. Place your remaining settlements, roads, and cities down in front of you.
Note: If you are playing a 3-player game, nobody plays the red position indicated on the starting map.
