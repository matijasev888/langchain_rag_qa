77Paired Player Turn Order
Player 1 performs this part of a turn just as you would in CATAN.
• Begin the turn with the production dice roll. All players take their resources  
(or any “7” roll is resolved) as usual in CATAN.
The Combined Trade/Build Phase is slightly different with the paired players rule.
Player 1 goes first and may do the following in any order:
• Trade resource cards with all players as usual AND trade resource cards with the 
supply as usual.
• Build anything shown on your “Building Costs” card and play 1 development card  
as usual.
After player 1 completes their portion of the paired turn, player 2 takes their part of 
the paired turn.
Player 2 may do the following in any order:
• Trade cards ONLY with the supply.
