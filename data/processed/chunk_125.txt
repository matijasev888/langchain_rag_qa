The player who mortgages property retains possession of it and 
no other player may secure it by lifting the mortgage from the Bank. 
However, the owner may sell this mortgaged property to another player 
at any agreed price. If you are the new owner, you may lift the mortgage 
at once if you wish by paying off the mortgage plus 
10% interest to the Bank. If the mortgage is not lifted 
at once, you must pay the Bank 10% interest when 
you buy the property and if you lift the 
mortgage later you must pay the Bank 
an additional 10% interest as well 
as the amount of the mortgage.
