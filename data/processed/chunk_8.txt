   To make it as easy as possible  for you to get started with  Catan, we use an award- winning rules system, which  consists of 3 parts—the  Overview, the Game  Rules, and  the Almanac.
   If you’ve never  
played Catan,  please read the  game Overview  first—it’s on the  back cover of this  booklet. Next, read the  Game Rules and start  to play. And finally, if you  have questions during the  game, please consult the  
Almanac (it begins on page 6).
