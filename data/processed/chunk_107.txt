GO for the first time. Once you collect that first $200 salary, you'll 
use the Speed Die for the rest of the game. This means that some 
players will start using the die before others. 
3. Once you start using the Speed Die, roll it along with the two 
white dice on your turn. Then do the following depending on 
what you rolled. 
1, 2, or 3: Add this number to the roll of the two white 
dice. You'll zoom around the board.
