Since the settlements and cities usually border on 2-3 terrain types, they can “harvest” up to 3 different resources based on 
the dice roll. Here, the white settlement [C] borders on forest, mountains, and pasture. A settlement at [D] would only harvest the production from 2 terrain hexes (hills and mountains). Finally, a settlement at [E] would only harvest the production from 1 terrain hex (pasture). However [E] is also at a wool harbor.
Since it’s impossible for you to have settlements adjacent to all terrain hexes and number tokens, you may receive certain 
resources only at rare intervals—or never. This is tough, because building requires specific resource combinations.
