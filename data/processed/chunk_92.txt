Assembling the Larger Board
To begin each game, you need to assemble the board. CATAN 5-6 uses a board very 
similar to the one in CATAN, but expanded with additional small sea frames.
Note: The 5 and 6 player games use all of the hexagonal tiles from CATAN 5-6 and all of the 
tiles from the CATAN base game. However, you only use the number tokens from this extension 
(lettered A to Y and ZA, ZB, and ZB).
