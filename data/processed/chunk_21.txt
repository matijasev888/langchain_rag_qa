Victory Point Cards (Orange Frame) Y
You must keep victory point cards hidden. 
You may only reveal them during your turn 
and when you are sure that you have 10 victory points—that is, to win the game. Of course, you can reveal them after the end of the game if someone else wins. You may play any number of victory point cards during your  turn, even during the turn you purchase them.
endin G the Game
If you have 10 or more victory points during your turn, 
the game ends and you are the winner! If you reach 10 points when it is not your turn, the game continues until any player (including you) has 10 points on their turn.
