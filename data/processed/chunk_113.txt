same space at the same time. 
According to the space your token reaches, you may be entitled to 
buy real estate or other properties - or obliged to pay rent, pay taxes, 
draw a Chance or Community Chest card, "Go to Jail," etc. 
If you throw doubles, you move your token as usual, the sum of the 
two dice, and are subject to any privileges or penalties pertaining to 
the space on which you land. Retaining the dice, throw again and move 
your token as before. If you throw doubles three times in succession, 
move your token immediately to the space marked "In Jail" (see JAIL).
