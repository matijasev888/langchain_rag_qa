A few minor details: 
Only the white dice are used when determining if you rolled doubles. 
Do not look at the Speed Die. 
If you roll a three-of-a-kind (all of the dice show the same number), 
you can move anywhere you want on the board! 
If you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the "Go 
to Jail" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row) then your turn 
is over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn. 
Use the white dice ONLY when rolling to get out of jail. 
L 
Use the sum of all three dice when determining how much to pay on 
a utility. Note: The Bus and Mr. Monopoly are valued at 0.
