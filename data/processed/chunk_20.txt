Knight Cards (Purple Frame) Y
If you play a knight card, you must 
immediately move the robber. See “Rolling 
a ‘7’ and Activating the Robber” above and follow steps 1 and 2.
Once played, knight cards remain face 
up in front of you. The first player to have 3 knight cards in front of themself receives the special card “Largest Army,” which is worth 2 victory points. If another player has more knight cards in front of them than the current holder of the Largest Army card, they immediately take the special card and its  2 victory points.
Progress Cards (Green Frame) Y
If you play a progress card, follow its 
instructions. Then the card is removed from  
the game (i.e., toss it in the box).
Victory Point Cards (Orange Frame) Y
You must keep victory point cards hidden.
