MORTGAGES: Unimproved properties can be mortgaged through the 
Bank at any time. Before an improved property can be mortgaged, all 
the buildings on all the properties of its color-group must be sold back 
to the Bank at half price. The mortgage value is printed on each Title 
Deed card. 
No rent can be collected on mortgaged properties or utilities, 
but rent can be collected on unmortgaged properties in the 
same group. 
In order to lift the mortgage, the owner must pay the Bank the 
amount of the mortgage plus 10% interest. When all the propert~es of 
a color-group are no longer mortgaged, the owner may begin to buy 
back houses at full price.
